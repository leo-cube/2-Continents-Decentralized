Project Decentralized Continentchat:

This is a open-source project, a more like a game or a app that is completely decentralized.

I think I need Python and JS to make this a done:
    a.) Simple chat (inputs, prompt) 
    b.) A place for algorithm.
    c.) Having crypto as a currency that will the store of value for this 2 continents.
    
Continent A:
    a.) This continent is Rich.
    b.) Their currency value is very high compared to B.
    c.) But lack major commodities and there has to be a running news which says there is going to be a 
        commodity crash soon in the continent A.
    d.) Thus Decentralized ppl can use this app to interact with other ppl who are on this chat.

Continent B:
    a.) Continent B is weak in economy but high in population.
    b.) There is excess commodity.

Contract for A & B:
    a.) A smart contract.
    b.) Must be a simple yes or no, agree or disagree
    c.) A predefined contract will be available where people can edit it and use.
    d.) Contracts can be minted.

Things to satisfy: 
    a.) Who is going to be dominant?
    b.) What is the work for algorithm in here?
    c.) How decentralization is achieved ?
    d.) Simple way to let people understand decentralization!
